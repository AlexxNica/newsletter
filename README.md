# newsletter

A repo for the Jupyter Newsletter

[Jupyter Newsletter](https://newsletter.jupyter.org) is published on Medium on a monthly basis. The publication is managed by Project Jupyter Operations and we welcome ideas for Jupyter related content from the community. To submit a story for consideration create a new issue here: https://github.com/jupyter/newsletter/issues - this will generate a template for you to follow. At a minimum your submission should include a headline and 2-4 sentences that support your headline. If they are available it is ideal to include both a link where the reader can get more information and a photo that represents or enhances your story. Be sure to label the story "topic suggestion".
